# Beezle Bug
In the [Otherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherland) series of cyberpunk novels Beezle Bug is the virtual assistant of Orlando Gardiner, one of the main characters.
Originally a kids' toy, it was upgraded many times until it's almost as sentient as a real person.
Beezle Bug has two different forms of appearance. In the virtual world it appears as a creature with many arms and legs. It can also download itself into a spider-like toy robot in the physical world.

## Vision and Goals
Like its fictional counterpart our Beezle Bug agent starts as a limited toy project and will hopefully grow into a useful tool over time.
Beezle is running completely local.

With Beezle Bug we want to explore agentive behaviours like
* Autonomy
* Cooperation
* Self Improvement

### Autonomy
Beezle Bug is an autonomous and proactive agent. First and foremost that means it's not waiting for user input 
to kickstart its internal processes but it's continously running 



What's working ?
* Run continuously every n seconds [x]
* Decide what to do next by choosing from a number of actions on every turn [x]
* Persist, manage and process memories [ ]
* Planning [ ]

### Cooperation
To be able to work on several things at the same time without confusing itself, Beezle Bug can clone itself and give its clone specific instructions. For example 

What's working ?
* create/start/stop/destroy a clone of itself [ ]
* delegate tasks to clone [ ]
* specialize the clone for specific tasks [ ]


### Self Improvement

What's working ?

### Task Decomposition and Delegation
The main agent may decide to break an identified task down into a number of subtasks and either work on them sequentially or start a number of (specialized) agents.
